                    <p class="descrip">"Ducks are honestly so wonderful. I've had Mr. Quackers for 3 years now, and I can honestly say that getting him was the best decision of my life. He's such a a lovely little guy and manages to make me smile every day."</p>

                    <p class="descrip">"Well, Constance definitely isn't the young chick she once was. She can be a bit touchy sometimes, but despite the occasionaly peck, I know she loves me. We've got one of those bonds - you know? I rescued her from a storm when she was young, and she's been with me ever since. I wouldn't have it any other way."</p>

                    <p class="descrip">"They - all of them - are just such a calming presence. They know when I'm getting stressed and will just pile on me for reassurance. I love them for that. They really care. Ducks are like that. Once you get a duck, you know there's no going back, because no other pet could ever live up to the expectations that a duck sets."</p>

                    <p class="descrip">"I cannot emphasize how much a I recommend getting a duck. They're the pet that anyone - and I mean anyone - could and would love. They're not too high maintenance, and they're basically just a cool pal that hangs around the house. I mean George is basically my best bro. Ducks are the best."</p>

                    <p class="descrip">"Ducks are great pets because they are always kinda just... there. Like, I got Simon and Garf when I was going through a quarter life crisis of sorts, and their presence just soothed me. They were my rocks in time when I really needed them."</p>

                    <p class="descrip">"Being an ageless god myself, it was important to me that I have a pet just as awesome. So naturally, I gravitated toward the duck. The duck is a very powerful creature, perfect to be the companion of a god. When I saw Duckules, I just knew that he was the one meant to be my pet. His eyes held a timeless wisdom, and he radiated an awe-inspiring confidence. Now, 3,000 years later, I can be confident that he was the right choice." </p>
